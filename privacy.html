  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>
    Our game is designed for children and families. We take privacy seriously and want you to feel safe.
  </p>
  <p>
    This app does not collect, store, or share any personal information. It runs entirely offline on your device once installed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Because the app is a paid product, there are no ads, trackers, or external connections. Your child’s experience is private and secure.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have any questions about this policy, please contact us through the support channel provided at purchase.
